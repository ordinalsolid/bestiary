    // Array of quotes
    const quotes = [
      "Myth transforms history into nature.<br>-Roland Barthes",
      "The animal becomes a visual shorthand, a symbol whose complexity is flattened for the sake of communication.<br>-Jonathan Burt",
      "In contemporary culture, the animal often serves as a stand-in for human virtues, vices, and fantasies, erasing its own reality.<br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast</i>",
      "The commodification of the animal denies its individuality, making it a vessel for human projections.<br>-Donna Haraway",
      "Once a friend came to visit and said, looking out on the soothing view; 'and it would have to be a white horse; the very image of freedom'. And I thought, yes, the animals are forced to become for us merely 'images' of what they once so beautifully expressed.<br>-Alice Walker, <i>Am I Blue?</i>",
      "Of course, the behavior of lions may be the least interesting thing about them. In the way of symbols, lions are pretty near the top of the tree. But would anyone have followed Richard the Lionheart if they had known how similar lions‚Äô behavior is to that of the common house cat?<br>-Justin Cartwright",
"It was a comment on human nature that the concept of \‚Äòanimality\‚Äô was devised.<br>-Keith Thomas",
"As I grew up I became more and more bewildered by the way people used to speak and think about animals, and I began to wonder, first in childish terms and later as a university educated adult, how on earth our society had arrived at its subject object attitude toward animals. Contrary to current notions about humans and animals I never once felt myself to be a superior human subject dealing with an inferior and passive animal object.<br>-Barbara Noske, <i>Humans and Other Animals</i>",
"Sentiments about animals are typically projections of attitudes to humans; that the contrasting of humans and animals invariably serves as an analogy for the relation of those regarded by a particular society as insiders or outsiders; and that some societies have arrogantly appropriated the name \‚Äòhuman\‚Äô for themselves while giving neighboring groups derogatory animal names. <br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast</i>",
"It seems modern Western culture more than any other emphasizes the \‚ÄòOtherness\‚Äô of the nonhuman. By drawing a sharp dividing line between human and nonhuman, a vast gap is created between subject (the free acting human agent) and the object (the passive acted upon thing).",
"The idea that animals are metaphorically indispensable to humankind has certain attractions, because it proposes a relation between humans and animals which is not necessarily and exploitative one, nor one which necessarily works by denigrating the animals. <br>-John Berger, <i>Animals as Metaphor</i>",
"Sometimes animals are idealized as models of order and morality. Sometimes animals are represented at the Other, the Beast, the Brute, the model of disorder and the way things should not be done.<br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast</i>", 
"The term animal is associated with uncivilized behavior and socially disapproved behavior. Criminals, hoodlums, and punks are described as animals that deserve to be punished if justice is to prevail. Animal represents a violation of social norms.<br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast</i>",
"If you want to clear out a room of Derrideans, mention Beatrix Potter without sneering.<br>-Ursula K LeGuin",
"Animals quite obviously cannot and do not represent themselves to human viewers. It is man who defines and represents them, and he can in no sense claim to achieve a true representation of any particular animal; it merely reflects his own concerns.<br>-Bob Mullan & Garry Marvin, <i>Zoo Culture</i>",
"A \'feral\' animal is one that exists in an ecosystem where they are considered out of place. Because of this, feral animal voices are often described as ‚Äúnoise.‚Äù<br>-Kristine Hill, <i>Uncivilized Behaviors</i>",
"Neoteny refers to a condition in which there is retention of youthful characteristics in adult form. Large eyes, rounded cheeks, short limbs result in a \‚Äòlovable\‚Äô object. Doll and toy manufacturers intuitively grasped this \‚Äòcuteness\‚Äô principle long ago in relation to animal products.<br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast</i>",
"Animals are preserved solely for human benefit, because human beings have decided they want them to exist for human pleasure.<br>-Bob Mullan and Garry Marvin, <i>Zoo Culture</i>",
"A real crocodile can be found in the zoo and as a rule it is dozing or hiding, but Disneyland tells us that faked nature corresponds much more to our daydream demands.<br>-Umberto Eco",
"Neither Disneyland or the zoo will satisfy the demand for a morally or politically correct image of animals, an image of animals as they should be seen, of animals running free in our imaginary mythical wild.<br>-Umberto Eco",
"We\‚Äôve had a very arrogant assumption of human superiority and I think that\‚Äôs what we‚Äôve got to change.<br>-Jane Goodall",
"In the past, families of all classes kept domestic animals because they served a useful purpose guard dogs, hunting dogs, micekilling cats, and so on. The practice of keeping animals regardless of their usefulness, the keeping, exactly, of pets (in the 16th century the word usually referred to a lamb raised by had) is a modern innovation, and, on the social scale on which it exists today, is unique. It is part of that universal but personal withdrawal into the private small family unit, decorated or furnished with mementoes from the outside world.<br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",
"Animals are always observed. The fact that they can observe us has lost all significance.<br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",
"Animals are objects of our everextending knowledge. What we know about the animal, is an index of our power, and thus an index of what separates us from the. The more we know, the further away they are.<br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",
"Everywhere animals disappear. In zoos they constitute the living monument to their own disappearance.<br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",
"The belief that \'animals\' are superior or inferior to humans because they live in an eternal now is untrue, because no being lives in a now.<br>-Timothy Morton",
"All beings are equal, but some beings are more equal than others.<br>-Timothy Morton",
"Animals are a lexicon of metaphor. They are a vocabulary apart from being living independent creatures.", 
"Put an animal in a story and it is never just an animal.<br>-Mark Haddon, <i>Dirk, Dolly and Dolores</i>",
"If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.<br>-Ludwig Wittgenstein,<i>Philosophical Investigation</i>s",
"Or maybe zoos are not just libraries where each pen, each cage, each enclosure is a volume from which valuable information should be extracted. Maybe zoos are not just storehouses of the exotic.<br>-Mark Haddon, <i>Dirk, Dolly and Dolores</i>",
"We can understand, too, that natural species are chosen not because they are \'good to eat\' [bonnes √† manger] but because they are \'good to think\' [bonnes √† penser].<br>-Claude Levi-Strauss, <i>Totemism</i>",
"Haribo\'s Gummi bears are junk food for children, but they are also a story about bears, about nature, and about ourselves.<br>Andrew McCumber and Patrick Neil Dryden, <i>The Bestiary in the Candy Aisle</i>",
"The bestiary in its original form is gone, but contemporary culture continues to catalog animals and in so doing assign them meaning, though that meaning making may go unnoticed.<br>-Andrew McCumber and Patrick Neil Dryden, <i>The Bestiary in the Candy Aisle</i>",
"Ever since 1902, when animal crackers were first massproduced by the National Biscuit Company, the foodindustrial complex has been targeting children with edible items fashioned as covetable objects.<br>-Kalman and Hall, <i>Eat Me</i>",
"Nabisco once released a limited edition \'Endangered Collection\' of Animal Crackers featuring Komodo dragons, peregrine falcons, Hawaiian monk seals, and Bactrian camels. When asked whether there was \'something weird about eating these near sacred animals,\' a product manager replied:\'Of course, what do people like about Animal Crackers? Biting off the heads! Our hope was that children will line them up, match them up with the names on the box, learn about them, and then decapitate them.\'<br>-Andrew McCumber and Patrick Neil Dryden, <i>The Bestiary in the Candy Aisle</i>",
"To see a jaguar is to be seen by a jaguar. Seeing is always reciprocal, and in this reciprocity, a certain form of personhood emerges.<br>-Eduardo Kohn, <i>How Forests Think</i>",
"An anthropology beyond the human must not only decenter the human but also learn to think with other forms of life that are themselves thinking beings.<br>-Eduardo Kohn, <i>How Forests Think</i>"
