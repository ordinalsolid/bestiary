      "001<br><br>Myth transforms history into nature.<br><br>-Roland Barthes",
      "002<br><br>The problem that arises for the study of animals in history is that treating the animal as an icon, paradoxically, places the animal outside history. The role is purely symbolic; it reflects historical processes without truly being part of them. Being detached from what might be called the historical dynamics of a culture makes it difficult to assess the manner in which animals influence these dynamics. <br><br>-Jonathan Burt, <a href='https://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/burt.pdf' target='_blank'><i>The Illumination of the Animal Kingdom:The Role of Light and Electricity in Animal Representation</i></a>",
		
"003<br><br>The animal becomes a visual shorthand, a symbol whose complexity is flattened for the sake of communication.<br><br>",

"004<br><br>In contemporary culture, the animal often serves as a standin for human virtues, vices, and fantasies, erasing its own reality.<br><br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast: Animals, Identity, and Representation</i>",

"005<br><br>The commodification of the animal denies its individuality, making it a vessel for human projections.<br><br>",

"006<br><br>Once a friend came to visit and said, looking out on the soothing view; \‘and it would have to be a white horse; the very image of freedom\'. And I thought, yes, the animals are forced to become for us merely \‘images\‘ of what they once so beautifully expressed.<br><br>-Alice Walker, <i>Am I Blue?</i>",

"007<br><br>Of course, the behavior of lions may be the least interesting thing about them. In the way of symbols, lions are pretty near the top of the tree. But would anyone have followed Richard the Lionheart if they had known how similar lions\’ behavior is to that of the common house cat?<br><br>-Justin Cartwright, <i>Look at It This Way</i>",

"008<br><br>It was a comment on human nature that the concept of \‘animality\’ was devised.<br><br>-Keith Thomas, <i>Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500-1800</i>",

"009<br><br>As I grew up I became more and more bewildered by the way people used to speak and think about animals, and I began to wonder, first in childish terms and later as a university educated adult, how on earth our society had arrived at its subject object attitude toward animals. Contrary to current notions about humans and animals I never once felt myself to be a superior human subject dealing with an inferior and passive animal object.<br><br>-Barbara Noske, <i>Humans and Other Animals</i>",

"010<br><br>Sentiments about animals are typically projections of attitudes to humans; that the contrasting of humans and animals invariably serves as an analogy for the relation of those regarded by a particular society as insiders or outsiders; and that some societies have arrogantly appropriated the name \‘human\’ for themselves while giving neighboring groups derogatory animal names.<br><br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast: animals, identity, and representation</i>",

"011<br><br>Imaginary animals are not less real than their counterparts in the natural world; they inhabit the landscapes of our collective psyche, serving as mirrors of human creativity and fear.<br><br>-Umberto Eco",

"012<br><br>The uncanny valley, where fake animals (like CGI characters in films or robotic animals) are close to the real thing but not quite right, creates a profound dissonance. It speaks to our anxieties about artificial life where humanity\'s technological interventions into nature (like cloning, genetic modification, or bioengineering) blur the line between \'real\' and \'fake\' animals.<br><br>",

"013<br><br>What we call nature is a story we tell about the world, an ongoing and inevitably incomplete narrative that is not limited by the human experience.<br><br>-Barbara Hernstein Smith",

"014<br><br>Animals are the metaphors we use to express ourselves. In them, we see our best and worst qualities, our desires and fears.<br><br>-Umberto Eco",

"015<br><br>We are in the Anthropocene, and as a result, many species of animals are dying out. But the Anthropocene is not just the end of something—it\‘s a new beginning, and in this new world, the fate of animals and humans will be intertwined.<br><br>-Timothy Morton",

"016<br><br>Animals are uncanny because they remind us of what we are, but also of what we are not. We think we know them, but when we look closely, they are always strange, always other.<br><br>-Timothy Morton",

"017<br><br>To see an animal is to experience a kind of aesthetic shock. We can no longer simply project our ideas onto it; we must encounter it as a being in its own right.<br><br>-Timothy Morton",

"018<br><br>The animal, in the field of comedy, is the one who remains foreign, the one who does not belong to our human order, but through its absurdity, it forces us to reconsider our own human limitations.<br><br>-Alenka Zupančič",

"019<br><br>Humans need the animal as a mirror for what they are not, for their own desire to escape human sociality. The animal is simultaneously the \'other\' and the \'self\' projected.<br><br>-Alenka Zupančič",

"020<br><br>Anthropomorphism is not an innocent process— it\’s a way of making the animal serve human ends, erasing the animal\’s own existence.<br><br>-Donna Haraway",

"021<br><br>The animal in advertising is never just an animal; it is a fantasy construct, a way of thinking about the human.<br><br>-Steve Baker",

"022<br><br>The animal in art or language is rarely the animal in itself— it is a construction that tells us more about ourselves than about the creature.<br><br>-Vicki Hearne",

"023<br><br>The cute animal image makes us feel connected, but it is a form of consumer escapism.<br><br>-Timothy Morton",

"024<br><br>I think of what wild animals are in our imaginations. And how they are disappearing– not just from the wild, but from people\’s everyday lives, replaced by images of themselves in print and on screen. The rarer they get, the fewer meanings animals can have. Eventually rarity is all they are made of.<br><br>—Helen Macdonald, <i>H is for Hawk</i>",

"025<br><br>Animals in advertising act as conduits for emotional connection, but the connection is always mediated by consumerism.<br><br>-Jonathan Burt, <a href='https://archive.org/details/animalsinfilm0000burt' target='_blank'><i>Animals in Film</i></a>",

"026<br><br>Cartoon animals have the ability to simultaneously reflect human behavior and amplify its absurdities, which makes them a mirror for both human desires and our inability to fully control them.<br><br>-Carl Platinga",

"027<br><br>As the philosopher Thomas Nagel explained, the only way to know what it is like to be a bat is to be a bat. But the imagining? The attempt? That is a good and important thing. It forces you to think about what you don\‘t know about the creature: what it eats, where it lives, how it communicates with others.<br><br>-Helen McDonald",

"028<br><br>None of us see animals clearly. They\‘re too full of the stories we\‘ve given them. Encountering them is an encounter with everything you\‘ve ever learned about them from previous sightings, from books, images, conversations.<br><br>-Helen McDonald",

"029<br><br>If domestication is about control, wildness and ferality are the loss of that control. Animals out of control are defined in part by where they find themselves as well as how closely connected to humanity they remain. Some species find themselves in an undefined space – not quite feral, not quite domesticated, but something rather unique.<br><br>-Kristine Hill & others, <i>Uncivilized Behavior: How Humans Wield 'Feral' to Assert Power (and Control) over Other Species</i>",

"030<br><br>Animals who have never been domesticated are not referred to as feral, even upon escape or release to the wild. A prime example can be found in the wild areas of Florida. Reptiles are called \‘exotic pets\‘ when kept in captivity, and when they escape they simply become non-native nuisance animals.<br><br>-Kristine Hill & others, <i>Uncivilized Behavior: How Humans Wield 'Feral' to Assert Power (and Control) over Other Species</i>",

"031<br><br>In the era of social media, animals are increasingly reduced to \'content\'—commodities to be consumed and circulated in virtual spaces. Whether it\’s a viral video of a dog performing a trick or a \'cute\' animal meme circulating on Instagram, the deeper ethical questions of what it means for an animal to be reduced to a mere object of entertainment are often overlooked.<br><br>-Cary Wolfe, <i>What is Posthumanism?</i>",

"032<br><br>In a culture where entertainment has become the dominant mode of interaction, animals, like everything else, are increasingly \'content-ized,\' their individuality erased in favor of spectacle. What does it mean for the very possibility of ethical relations with other species when the most common interactions with animals occur through the lens of a screen, distanced, commodified, and sanitized for human pleasure?<br><br>-Cary Wolfe, <i>What is Posthumanism?</i>",

"033<br><br>The proliferation of images that reduce animals to symbols of human affection and desire—the cuteness of a dog in a viral video or the playful antics of a cat—works to displace the real relationality we might have with them. This infantilization and commodification of animals in media is part of the ongoing alienation of our engagements with the species we share the planet with.<br><br>-Donna Haraway",

"034<br><br>Cuteness has become an economic force in itself, especially on social media. Animals are often used by corporations to generate emotional responses in consumers, turning them into consumable and emotional objects. This reduction of animals to \'products\' serves both a cultural and economic function, allowing us to connect with animals only through the lens of what they represent to us—affection, entertainment, or affect.<br><br>-Sarah Banet-Weiser",

"035<br><br>The cuteness of an animal online—whether it\‘’s a pet or a wild animal in a viral video—has nothing to do with its ecological reality. Animals become part of a hyperobject in digital media, where their physical existence is dissolved into endless images that serve no other purpose than to be consumed.<br><br>-Timothy Morton, <i>Hyperobjects</i>",
		
"036<br><br>The meme, in its digital form, functions as a cultural unit that can be easily consumed, shared, and transformed. Animal memes, often designed around their cuteness, humor, or relatability, provide a way to engage with audiences across cultures and demographics. In a digital world of viral content, animals function as avatars because they are instantly recognizable and emotionally engaging, making them easier to commodify and circulate.<br><br>-Lev Manovich",

"037<br><br>Animals in memes serve as avatars for human experiences. Whether it\’s a grumpy cat, a dog in an awkward situation, or a cheerful puppy, animals in memes are transformed into familiar avatars that reflect human emotional experiences and social contexts. They become proxies for human behavior, allowing people to project their feelings, desires, or critiques onto the animal figure.<br><br>-Milan Katic",

"038<br><br>The digital landscape, where animals appear as memes, viral content, and icons, is no different from the medieval bestiary in one sense. Both serve as moral spaces where animals are reduced to symbols of human ideas—whether it\’s the innocence of a kitten or the strength of a lion. The difference is that the medieval bestiary was grounded in spiritual or moral teaching, while today, animals serve as vehicles for entertainment or marketing, shaping our perception through an almost constant stream of content.<br><br>-Geoffrey C. Bowker",

"039<br><br>When we see an animal in a meme, it is hard to decouple the digital image from the projected emotions we associate with it—cuteness, humor, love. Animals, in these contexts, function as avatars for human psychic needs, which distances us from the ecological reality of their existence. It is much like the medieval bestiary, where the animal was rendered as an object to teach moral lessons or symbolize human traits.<br><br>-Timothy Morton, <i>Hyperobjects</i>",

"040<br><br>Merry Christmas, ya filthy animal.<br><br>-Kevin McAllister, <i>Home Alone</i>",

"041<br><br>The idea that animals are metaphorically indispensable to humankind has certain attractions, because it proposes a relation between humans and animals which is not necessarily and exploitative one, nor one which necessarily works by denigrating the animals.<br><br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast: animals, identity, and representation</i>",

"042<br><br>Sometimes animals are idealized as models of order and morality. Sometimes animals are represented at the Other, the Beast, the Brute, the model of disorder and the way things should not be done.<br><br>-Richard Tapper, <i>Animality, humanity, morality, society</i>",

"043<br><br>The term animal is associated with uncivilized behavior and socially disapproved behavior. Criminals, hoodlums, and punks are described as animals that deserve to be punished if justice is to prevail. Animal represents a violation of social norms.<br><br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast: animals, identity, and representation</i>",

"044<br><br>If you want to clear out a room of Derrideans, mention Beatrix Potter without sneering.<br><br>-Ursula K LeGuin, <i>Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences</i>",

"045<br><br>Animals quite obviously cannot and do not represent themselves to human viewers. It is man who defines and represents them, and he can in no sense claim to achieve a true representation of any particular animal; it merely reflects his own concerns.<br><br>-Bob Mullan & Garry Marvin, <i>Zoo Culture</i>",

"046<br><br>A \'feral\' animal is one that exists in an ecosystem where they are considered out of place. Because of this, feral animal voices are often described as \‘noise.\‘<br><br>-Kristine Hill, <i>Uncivilized Behaviors</i>",

"047<br><br>Neoteny refers to a condition in which there is retention of youthful characteristics in adult form. Large eyes, rounded cheeks, short limbs result in a \‘lovable\’ object. Doll and toy manufacturers intuitively grasped this \‘cuteness\’ principle long ago in relation to animal products.<br><br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast: animals, identity, and representation</i>",

"048<br><br>Animals are preserved solely for human benefit, because human beings have decided they want them to exist for human pleasure.<br><br>-Bob Mullan and Garry Marvin, <i>Zoo Culture</i>",

"049<br><br>A real crocodile can be found in the zoo and as a rule it is dozing or hiding, but Disneyland tells us that faked nature corresponds much more to our daydream demands.<br><br>-Umberto Eco",

"050<br><br>Neither Disneyland or the zoo will satisfy the demand for a morally or politically correct image of animals, an image of animals <i>as they should be seen</i>, of animals running free in our imaginary mythical wild.<br><br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast: animals, identity, and representation</i>",

"051<br><br>For the Western television viewer, observing the antics of a strange and exotic animal on his screen, he might as well be watching a work of science fiction as a nature documentary. <br><br>-Tim Ingold, <i>What Is an Animal?</i>",

"052<br><br>We\’ve had a very arrogant assumption of human superiority and I think that\’s what we’ve got to change.<br><br>-Jane Goodall",

"053<br><br>In the past, families of all classes kept domestic animals because they served a useful purpose guard dogs, hunting dogs, micekilling cats, and so on. The practice of keeping animals regardless of their usefulness, the keeping, exactly, of pets (in the 16th century the word usually referred to a lamb raised by had) is a modern innovation, and, on the social scale on which it exists today, is unique. It is part of that universal but personal withdrawal into the private small family unit, decorated or furnished with mementoes from the outside world.<br><br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",

"054<br><br>Animals are always observed. The fact that they can observe us has lost all significance.<br><br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",

"055<br><br>Animals are objects of our everextending knowledge. What we know about the animal, is an index of our power, and thus an index of what separates us from the. The more we know, the further away they are.<br><br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",

"056<br><br>Everywhere animals disappear. In zoos they constitute the living monument to their own disappearance.<br><br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",

"057<br><br>The belief that \'animals\' are superior or inferior to humans because they live in an eternal now is untrue, because no being lives in a now.<br><br>-Timothy Morton",

"058<br><br>All beings are equal, but some beings are more equal than others.<br><br>-Timothy Morton",

"059<br><br>Put an animal in a story and it is never just an animal.<br><br>-Mark Haddon, <a href='https://aeon.co/essays/animals-have-things-to-say-they-re-just-not-saying-them-to-us' target='_blank'><i>Dirk, Dolly and Dolores</i></a>",

"060<br><br>If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.<br><br>-Ludwig Wittgenstein, <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>",

"061<br><br>Or maybe zoos are not just libraries where each pen, each cage, each enclosure is a volume from which valuable information should be extracted. Maybe zoos are not just storehouses of the exotic.<br><br>-Mark Haddon, <a href='https://aeon.co/essays/animals-have-things-to-say-they-re-just-not-saying-them-to-us' target='_blank'><i>Dirk, Dolly and Dolores</i></a>",

"062<br><br>We can understand, too, that natural species are chosen not because they are \'good to eat\' [bonnes à manger] but because they are \'good to think\' [bonnes à penser].<br><br>-Claude Levi-Strauss, <i>Totemism</i>",

"063<br><br>Haribo\'s Gummi bears are junk food for children, but they are also a story about bears, about nature, and about ourselves.<br><br>Andrew McCumber and Patrick Neil Dryden, <a href='https://read.dukeupress.edu/environmental-humanities/article/14/1/110/294331/The-Bestiary-in-the-Candy-AisleA-Framework-for' target='_blank'><i>The Bestiary in the Candy Aisle</i></a>",

"064<br><br>The bestiary in its original form is gone, but contemporary culture continues to catalog animals and in so doing assign them meaning, though that meaning making may go unnoticed.<br><br>-Andrew McCumber and Patrick Neil Dryden, <a href='https://read.dukeupress.edu/environmental-humanities/article/14/1/110/294331/The-Bestiary-in-the-Candy-AisleA-Framework-for' target='_blank'><i>The Bestiary in the Candy Aisle</i></a>",

"065<br><br>Ever since 1902, when animal crackers were first massproduced by the National Biscuit Company, the foodindustrial complex has been targeting children with edible items fashioned as covetable objects.<br><br>-Tibor Kalman and Peter Hall, <i>Eat Me: Are We Ready for the Birth of Snackitecture</i>",

"066<br><br>Nabisco once released a limited edition \'Endangered Collection\' of Animal Crackers featuring Komodo dragons, peregrine falcons, Hawaiian monk seals, and Bactrian camels. When asked whether there was \'something weird about eating these near sacred animals,\' a product manager replied: \'Of course, what do people like about Animal Crackers? Biting off the heads! Our hope was that children will line them up, match them up with the names on the box, learn about them, and then decapitate them.\'<br><br>-Andrew McCumber and Patrick Neil Dryden, <a href='https://read.dukeupress.edu/environmental-humanities/article/14/1/110/294331/The-Bestiary-in-the-Candy-AisleA-Framework-for' target='_blank'><i>The Bestiary in the Candy Aisle</i></a>",

"067<br><br>To see a jaguar is to be seen by a jaguar. Seeing is always reciprocal, and in this reciprocity, a certain form of personhood emerges.<br><br>-Eduardo Kohn, <i>How Forests Think: Toward an Anthropology Beyond the Human</i>",

"068<br><br>Moo Deng, a tender hippopotamus who is but two months old, is the protagonist of any story you want to tell. She\'s you, she\'s me, she\'s All Of Us wallowing around in the mud just trying to cope. I think that\'s worth keeping in mind whenever something moves culture. Next time you want to create something with staying power, consider- How is that image, idea, song, video, or meme helping people express something about themselves they didn\'t have the tools to express before?<br><br>-Harris Sockel, <a href='https://dimzou.feat.com/en/dimzou/1357676/1362341' target='_blank'><i>Moo Deng: or how memes work</i></a>",

"069<br><br>Virtual pets function as a way to experience caregiving while circumventing the ethical questions associated with real animals, such as cruelty, neglect, or death. This detachment risks trivializing the complexities of human-animal relationships.<br><br>-Anne Balsamo, <i>Technologies of the Gendered Body: Reading Cyborg Women</i>",

"070<br><br>Animals are not just symbols or metaphors; they are coshapers of shared worlds. To represent them responsibly is to recognize their agency and their role in shaping our lives and histories.<br><br>-Donna Haraway, <i>When Species Meet</i>",

"071<br><br>To represent animals is to grapple with the limits of human language and vision, to acknowledge the creaturely vulnerability that binds all living beings.<br><br>-Anat Pick, <i>Creaturely Poetics: Animality and Vulnerability in Literature and Film</i>",

"072<br><br>The tiger that roams my dreams<br>is not the tiger of flesh.<br>It is a symbol of the eternal,<br>of what eludes my grasp.<br><br>-Jorge Luis Borges, <i>Dreamtigers</i>",

"073<br><br>Tyger Tyger, burning bright,<br>In the forests of the night;<br>What immortal hand or eye,<br>Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br><br>-William Blake, <i>Songs of Experience</i>",

"074<br><br>The animal has been transformed into spectacle. Instead of being seen as a cohabitant of the Earth, the animal is reduced to an object of the human gaze, a cipher for human concerns.<br><br>-John Berger, <i>Why Look at Animals?</i>",

"075<br><br>By conditioning us to care for something synthetic, Tamagotchi and similar virtual pets raise questions about whether we are eroding our capacity to empathize with living creatures.<br><br>-Sherry Turkle, <i>Alone Together- Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other</i>",

"076<br><br>A stuffed animal, for instance, is not just a memento of nature; it becomes an idealized version, frozen in time, and in many cases, more alive in death than it ever was in life.<br><br>-Umberto Eco",

"077<br><br>Virtual pets like Tamagotchi mimic the experience of owning a real animal but without the unpredictability or ethical dilemmas. They reveal how much of our bond with animals is rooted in caregiving behaviors rather than mutual understanding.<br><br>-Jean-Loup Rault, <a href='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4672182/' target='_blank'><i>Pets in the Digital Age- Live, Robot, or Virtual?</i></a>",

"078<br><br>Depending on the amount of care, Tamagotchi evolves into various kinds of shapes from egg to adult. If we neglect it, then when it reaches the end of its lifespan, the creature dies, like a 'real' animal. It is however possible to push the reset button, to begin a new life again.<br><br>-Maya Takahashi, <a href='https://skemman.is/handle/1946/47865?locale=en' target='_blank'><i>Understanding Human Relationships with Virtual Pets through Visual Communication</i></a>",

"079<br><br>The world continually emerges through the activities of its inhabitants, human and nonhuman alike. We do not dwell in a preexisting world; we create it through our movements, perceptions, and interactions.<br><br>-Tim Ingold, <i>The Perception of the Environment</i>",

"080<br><br>An anthropology beyond the human must not only decenter the human but also learn to think with other forms of life that are themselves thinking beings.<br><br>-Eduardo Kohn, <i>How Forests Think: Toward an Anthropology Beyond the Human</i>",

"081<br><br>As for the belief in fabulous creatures, old habits are often difficult to break. Although we scoff at the existence of Griffins and Unicorns, these creatures are still very much part of our modern lives.<br><br>-Aura Beckhöfer-Fialho, <i>Medieval Bestiaries and the Birth of Zoology</i>",

"082<br><br>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, 'Morning, boys. How's the water?'<br><br>And the two young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and says, 'What the hell is water?'<br><br>-David Foster Wallace",

"083<br><br>The yearning to understand what it would be like to be, say, an elephant or a cheetah scrambles the opposition between anthropomorphism and zoomorphism, that is, between humanizing animals and animalizing humans. This extreme form of thinking with animals is the impossible but irresistible desire to jump out of one\'s brain, plunge into another way of being.<br><br>-Lorraine Dalston and Gregg Mitman, <i>Introduction: The How and Why of Thinking with Animals</i>",

"084<br><br>Animals! The object of insatiable interest, examples of the riddle of life, created, as it were, to reveal the human being to man himself, displaying his richness and complexity in a thousand kaleidoscopic possibilities, each of them brought to some curiosities end.<br><br>-Bruno Schultz, <i>The Street of Crocodiles</i>",

"085<br><br>The contemporary Internet was designed, in no small part, for the dissemination of cute pictures of cats.<br><br>-Ethan Zuckerman, <a href='https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/78899' target='_blank'><i>Cute Cats to the Rescue? Participatory Media and Political Expression</i></a>",

"086<br><br>Life is no way to treat an animal.<br><br>-Kurt Vonnegut, <i>A Man Without a Country</i>",

"087<br><br>Medieval people did not see animals as we do; they saw them as moral lessons, divine messages written in fur and feather.<br><br>-T.H. White, <i>The Bestiary: A Book of Beasts</i>",

"088<br><br>Animals haunt the modern world as ghosts, presences that are always absent, as if their disappearance defines our era.<br><br>-Akira Mizuta Lippit, <i>Electric Animal: Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife</i>",

"089<br><br>In mythology and art, animals become more than themselves— they are abstractions of nature\‘ power and mystery, a means for humans to articulate what lies beyond their understanding.<br><br>-Alexander von Humboldt",

"090<br><br>The boundaries between the human and the animal in medieval thought were always porous, always in flux.<br><br>-Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, <i>Medieval Identity Machines</i>",

"091<br><br>When, as a child, I was told about the invention of the telegraph the question which most interested me was, wherever did the swallows gather for their autumn migration before there were telegraph wires?”<br><br>-Karl von Frisch, <i>The Dancing Bees: An Account of the Life and Sense of the Honey Bee</i>",

"092<br><br>Although animals have always haunted the topology of human subjectivity, the nature of the animal has shifted in the modern era from the metaphysic to a phantasm; from a body to an image; from a living voice to a technical echo.<br><br>-Akira Mizuta Lippit, <i>Electric Animal: Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife</i>",

"093<br><br>It follows that the elimination of animals from the human atmosphere is irreparable from the perspective of modern humanity. Thus animals disappear; it is thus that animals disappear; it is inevitable that animals disappear. From the elusive vantage point of the animal, one cannot say that it is thus— animals cannot say (for more than one reason) that they have disappeared.<br><br>-Akira Mizuta Lippit, <i>Electric Animal: Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife</i>",

"094<br><br>By displacing animals from the phenomenal world, humanity disrupts the delicate balance between human beings and animals (among other forms of nature such as plants, insects, raw materials, land and water formations, diurnal and nocturnal dynamics, atmospheric conditions, and so on)— a balance that had, in fact, constituted the very humanness of the human world.<br><br>-Akira Mizuta Lippit, <i>Electric Animal: Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife</i>",

"095<br><br>Animals never <i>entirely</i> vanish. Rather, they exist in a state of <i>perpetual vanishing</i>. Animals enter a new economy of being during the modern period, one that is no longer sacrificial in the traditional sense of the term but, considering modern technological media generally and the cinema more specifically, <i>spectral</i>. In supernatural terms, modernity finds animals lingering in the world <i>undead</i>.<br><br>-Lippit, <i>Electric Animal: Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife</i>",

"096<br><br>Western myths are loaded with creatures that are hybrids of two or more species. And in the western tradition that is rarely a good thing. They are warning signs. Often the product of divine trauma.<br><br>-Richard Pell, <a href='https://landezine.com/culture-of-artifacts-postnatural-by-richard-pell/' target='_blank'><i>Culture of Artifacts, Postnatural by Richard Pell</i></a>",

"097<br><br>Some of the lessons in these bestiaries have a dark side. Throughout, there are textual and visual references that were intended to encourage anti-Semitic and misogynist beliefs. They are not always obvious to us today, but their meaning would have been clear to people in medieval England. A story about a siren may seem like a harmless myth, but it was a tale used to demonize women who feel and express sexual desire: the lesson here is that such feelings turn women not only into threats to men but unwomanly 'beasts.'<br><br>-Hana Videen, <a href='https://lithub.com/why-we-anthropomorphize-animals-and-always-have/' target='_blank'><i>Why We Anthropomorphize Animals (and Always Have)</i></a>",
		
"098<br><br>Myth transforms history into nature.<br><br>-Roland Barthes",

"099<br><br>The problem that arises for the study of animals in history is that treating the animal as an icon, paradoxically, places the animal outside history. The role is purely symbolic; it reflects historical processes without truly being part of them. Being detached from what might be called the historical dynamics of a culture makes it difficult to assess the manner in which animals influence these dynamics. <br><br>-Jonathan Burt, <a href='https://www.animalsandsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/burt.pdf' target='_blank'><i>The Illumination of the Animal Kingdom: The Role of Light and Electricity in Animal Representation</i></a>",

"100<br><br>The animal becomes a visual shorthand, a symbol whose complexity is flattened for the sake of communication.<br><br>-Jonathan Burt",

"101<br><br>In contemporary culture, the animal often serves as a stand-in for human virtues, vices, and fantasies, erasing its own reality.<br><br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast: Animals, Identity, and Representation</i>",

"102<br><br>The commodification of the animal denies its individuality, making it a vessel for human projections.<br><br>-Donna Haraway",

"103<br><br>Once a friend came to visit and said, looking out on the soothing view; 'and it would have to be a white horse; the very image of freedom'. And I thought, yes, the animals are forced to become for us merely 'images' of what they once so beautifully expressed.<br><br>-Alice Walker, <i>Am I Blue?</i>",

"104<br><br>Of course, the behavior of lions may be the least interesting thing about them. In the way of symbols, lions are pretty near the top of the tree. But would anyone have followed Richard the Lionheart if they had known how similar lions’ behavior is to that of the common house cat?<br><br>-Justin Cartwright, <i>Look at It This Way</i>",

"105<br><br>It was a comment on human nature that the concept of 'animality' was devised.<br><br>-Keith Thomas, <i>Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500-1800</i>",

"106<br><br>As I grew up I became more and more bewildered by the way people used to speak and think about animals, and I began to wonder, first in childish terms and later as a university educated adult, how on earth our society had arrived at its subject-object attitude toward animals. Contrary to current notions about humans and animals I never once felt myself to be a superior human subject dealing with an inferior and passive animal object.<br><br>-Barbara Noske, <i>Humans and Other Animals</i>",

"107<br><br>Sentiments about animals are typically projections of attitudes to humans; that the contrasting of humans and animals invariably serves as an analogy for the relation of those regarded by a particular society as insiders or outsiders; and that some societies have arrogantly appropriated the name 'human' for themselves while giving neighboring groups derogatory animal names.<br><br>-Steve Baker, <i>Picturing the Beast: animals, identity, and representation</i>",

"108<br><br>Imaginary animals are not less real than their counterparts in the natural world; they inhabit the landscapes of our collective psyche, serving as mirrors of human creativity and fear.<br><br>-Umberto Eco",

"109<br><br>The uncanny valley, where fake animals (like CGI characters in films or robotic animals) are close to the real thing but not quite right, creates a profound dissonance. It speaks to our anxieties about artificial life where humanity's technological interventions into nature (like cloning, genetic modification, or bioengineering) blur the line between 'real' and 'fake' animals.<br><br>-Mark Fisher",

"110<br><br>What we call nature is a story we tell about the world, an ongoing and inevitably incomplete narrative that is not limited by the human experience.<br><br>-Barbara Hernstein Smith",

"111<br><br>Animals are the metaphors we use to express ourselves. In them, we see our best and worst qualities, our desires and fears.<br><br>-Umberto Eco",

"112<br><br>We are in the Anthropocene, and as a result, many species of animals are dying out. But the Anthropocene is not just the end of something—it’s a new beginning, and in this new world, the fate of animals and humans will be intertwined.<br><br>-Timothy Morton",
